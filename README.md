# 🏡 Ames Housing Data Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores the **Ames Housing Dataset** (sourced from Kaggle) using Python-based data analysis techniques.  
The main objective was to **perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), identify trends, and visualize housing market patterns**.  

This project was completed as part of my **7-day journey to learn Data Analysis with Python**, where I applied all concepts I practiced during the week into a **hands-on project**.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess the Ames Housing dataset.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Uncover insights about housing prices, sales trends, and property features.  
- Use visualizations to represent trends effectively.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- **Python** (Data Analysis & Visualization)  
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualizations)  
- **NumPy** (Numerical operations)

## 📊 Key Insights  

1. **Sales Trends Over Time**  
   - Distribution of sales across years and months.  
   - Seasonal peaks observed in summer months.  

2. **Price Distribution**  
   - Sale prices show a right-skewed distribution.  
   - Log transformation helped normalize the data for better analysis.  

3. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Strong positive correlation between **Overall Quality** and **Sale Price**.  
   - Living Area and Garage Cars also showed a significant influence on price.  

4. **Heatmap of Sale Prices (Year vs. Month)**  
   - Clear visualization of how housing prices varied across different months and years.  
   - Patterns of growth and decline in certain periods were highlighted.

## 🚀 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Loading** – Imported the Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, duplicates, and categorical encodings.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Used descriptive statistics, correlations, and visualizations.  
4. **Insights & Visualization** – Highlighted trends through plots and heatmaps.  
5. **Documentation** – Summarized findings and structured the workflow.
